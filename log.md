##### 
**Today's Progress**: **Python:** a few lessons and half of Carly's Clippers

**Thoughts:** Didn't do as much as I normally would (and had to postpone a day of JavaScript30) because I got home pretty late from a client meeting. Lawyer life.

**Link to work:** n/a

### Day 4: June 11, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: **Python:** Lovely Loveseats (Codecademy), more Python lessons; **JavaScript:** Array Cardio Day 1 (JavaScript30)

**Thoughts:** I didn't do as much today as previous days. I am happy about doing the Array Cardio exercises because I often get confused by functions like `reduce()` and `map()`. It's good to get more practice!

### Day 3: June 10, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Playing with CSS Variables & JS (JavaScript30), Build a To-Do List (Enlight)

**Thoughts:** I loved making this to-do list app and customizing it just a little. I'm excited to work on actual web apps.

### Day 2: June 9, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript CSS & JS Clock (JavaScript30), began learning Python on Codecademy, first 3 levels of Plant Your Code 

**Thoughts:** Python feels so weird. I'm constantly about to put a semicolon at the end of a line before I realize, nope! Plant Your Code is fun but 1.3 killed me for some reason. I even took notes about methods that work on arrays and still couldn't figure out how to do it. I probably spent more than an hour doing it over and over until finally it came out right!

### Day 1: June 8, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Drum Kit (JavaScript30), Codecademy Natural Language Processing Bag-of-Words Language Model, Tf-idf & Word Embeddings

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying learning about NLP but I clearly need to learn at least some Python to make it easier.
