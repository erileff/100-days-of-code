# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: June 9 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript CSS & JS Clock (JavaScript30), began learning Python on Codecademy, first 3 levels of Plant Your Code 

**Thoughts:** Python feels so weird. I'm constantly about to put a semicolon at the end of a line before I realize, nope! Plant Your Code is fun but 1.3 killed me for some reason. I even took notes about methods that work on arrays and still couldn't figure out how to do it. I probably spent more than an hour doing it over and over until finally it came out right!

### Day 1: June 8, 2020
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Drum Kit (JavaScript30), Codecademy Natural Language Processing Bag-of-Words Language Model, Tf-idf & Word Embeddings

**Thoughts:** I'm really enjoying learning about NLP but I clearly need to learn at least some Python to make it easier.
